  I am a senior majoring in Cognitive Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a minor in Computer Science. Through my time at RPI, I have participated in a number of self-designed projects, both independently and in academic courses. My variety of experiences explaining software through write ups and presentations make me an ideal technical writing candidate. <br />
